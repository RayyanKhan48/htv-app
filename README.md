## Goal
Our goal is to form a community of environmentally conscious students, and later on scale it for the public, while making the world a cleaner place. Raising awareness about in-campus sustainability among students and even faculty members, where everyone involved can benefit and actively take part in contributing towards a greener earth. By the simple acts done by students, we can build the bridge from environment friendliness to actual student life. A percentage of the profits gained from the app will make further impacts via donations towards environmental charities.

## Functionality
### Basic Working:
- Download the X app.
- Students are asked to Login or Sign Up with their UTORid.
- Scan the QR code from the app after performing said activities to earn points.
- Accumulate points and rise up the leaderboard.
- Redeem/Donate points whenever you want!

### Earning Points:
- Water dispensing station where you can use reusable water bottle and scan for points.
- Using reusable containers at cafeteria instead of taking paper of plastic plates.
- Gain points for buying eco-friendly products from the bookstore.
- Volunteering in activites such as planting trees in a student-run garden, river and park cleanups.
- Earn additional points by having a 7-day streak.

### Using Points:
<strong>Redeem</strong> : Points can be redeemed from the app directly as cashback or as discounts from stores on campus. <br>
<strong>Donate</strong> : Points can be used to donate for environmental causes to NGOs such as Greenpeace and World Wildlife Fund.

### Gamification:
This app incorporates various concepts and strategies and gamification is one of the major ones. It includes a leaderboard page that shows the list of students who gained the most points throughout the semester. Apart from this, it has weekly streaks for additional rewards and weekly recommended events. Moreover, it also displays positive reinforcement messages that show up on the Home Page, that keeps the user motivated. Competing with other players and getting a reward at the end of the semester is something everyone would look forward to, and try to achieve, which makes it all the more important during the development process.
